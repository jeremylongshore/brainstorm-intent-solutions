## Parallel Work Opportunities

Tasks that can be done simultaneously:

**Week 1-2 Parallel Work**:
- Set up Airtable (primary task)
- Collect API credentials (can happen concurrently)
- Test individual platforms manually (async)

**Week 3-4 Parallel Work**:
- LinkedIn integration (one developer)
- X integration (another developer or same, parallel testing)
- Discord/Slack (quick wins, low priority)
- Website publishing (separate track)

**Week 5-6 Parallel Work**:
- Content formatting refinement (copywriting)
- Error handling (engineering)
- Documentation (technical writing)
- Monitoring setup (devops)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Blockers

**1. API Rate Limiting**
- **Risk**: LinkedIn/X rate limits hit quickly
- **Mitigation**: Start with low volume, add throttling early
- **Contingency**: Queue posts for next cycle, prioritize high-quality

**2. AI Analysis Costs**
- **Risk**: OpenRouter costs higher than expected
- **Mitigation**: Batch processing, use GPT-4o-mini (cheap)
- **Contingency**: Reduce analysis frequency, increase quality threshold

**3. Feed Reliability**
- **Risk**: RSS feeds go down or change format
- **Mitigation**: Error handling with retries, log failures
- **Contingency**: Disable problematic feeds, find alternatives

**4. Content Quality Issues**
- **Risk**: AI assigns incorrect quality scores
- **Mitigation**: Manual review of first 50-100 articles
- **Contingency**: Adjust prompt, add human review queue

**5. Platform Account Issues**
- **Risk**: LinkedIn/X accounts flagged for automation
- **Mitigation**: Respect rate limits, use official APIs, human-like timing
- **Contingency**: Reduce posting frequency, add manual approval step

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Per Node)

**RSS Fetching**:
- Test 5 feeds individually
- Test parallel execution with 33 feeds
- Test error handling (invalid URLs)
- Verify timeout behavior

**AI Analysis**:
- Test with 1 article (baseline)
- Test with 10 articles (batch)
- Test with low-quality content
- Verify JSON output format

**Distribution**:
- Test each platform individually
- Test simultaneous distribution
- Test with failed platform
- Verify retry logic

### Integration Testing (Full Workflow)

**Happy Path**:
1. New content in 5 feeds
2. AI analysis assigns scores
3. Content stored in Airtable
4. Routed to correct brands
5. Posted to all platforms
6. Monitoring alerts sent

**Edge Cases**:
1. Zero new content (should skip)
2. All feeds fail (should alert)
3. AI analysis fails (should retry/fallback)
4. Platform unavailable (should queue)
5. Duplicate content (should skip)

### Load Testing

**High Volume**:
- Simulate 100+ new articles
- Verify batch processing
- Monitor execution time
- Check API rate limits

**Sustained Operation**:
- Run for 7 days continuously
- Monitor for memory leaks
- Check timestamp accuracy
- Verify no missed content

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Review this roadmap with stakeholders
2. Prioritize phases (can skip Phase 4 initially if needed)
3. Allocate developer time
4. Set up Airtable base (Phase 1 Task 1.1)
5. Collect API credentials (Phase 1 Task 1.2)

**Decision Points**:
- Which brands to launch first? (Start with Intent Solutions + StartAITools?)
- Which platforms to prioritize? (LinkedIn + website first?)
- How much manual review before automation? (Recommend 50 articles)
- When to go live? (Soft launch vs full launch)
